# Instructions
1. A create database statement which creates a database named a2.
2. A create table statement which creates a table named your first name_partner's first name (if applicable), with at least three fields.  So, let's take a student named Skip Kiddie:
 a. If Skip is working with classmate John Doe, they would create a table named skip-john.
 b. If Skip is working alone, he would create a table named skip.
3. The types for the 3+ fields must include:
 a. a variable length string
 b. a number
 c. some other type of your choosing.
4. Write at least five insert statements for inserting data into your table -- the insert statements must include at least one of each of the five types, as shown in the Lecture and Chapter 1 of the book:
 a. insert statement that specifies all field/column names
 b. insert statement that omits all field/column names
 c. insert statement that changes the order of fields/columns
 d. insert statement that leaves fields/columns out (must include 1+ fields/columns, but not all)
 e. insert statement that adds multiple records at once
5. Write a drop table statement for your table as well.
